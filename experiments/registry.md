# Experiment Registry

Every experiment is registered **before** it runs: ID, objective,
hypothesis, configuration, decision rule, expected result. The actual
result is filled in afterwards and never edits the prediction. Entries
for work that predates this registry carry an explicit
`registered: retrospectively` field; the registry is forward-looking
from 2026-07-19 on.

Metric reporting rules (binding, see [../docs/evaluation.md](../docs/evaluation.md)):
confidence intervals always, paired tests for paired comparisons, a
multiple-comparison correction when strata are tested jointly.

## E-001 — Graph traversal vs. vector baseline on the golden set

- **Registered:** 2026-07-19 (a priori — predictions were recorded in
  [../docs/evaluation.md](../docs/evaluation.md) and
  `data/golden/*.jsonl` before any retrieval system existed).
- **Objective:** test the central hypothesis
  ([../docs/hypothesis.md](../docs/hypothesis.md)) that judge-level
  questions are path-shaped and measurably out of reach of vector
  retrieval.
- **Hypothesis / predictions:** per-question `vector_should` labels —
  39 fail / 23 lose / 15 tie across 77 questions. The `tie` stratum
  (`definition_1hop`) is the falsifier: if the graph "wins" there too,
  distrust the harness before celebrating.
- **Configuration:** frozen golden set v0 (77 questions, all
  verified); graph pipeline (Phases 4–5) vs. the Project 1 vector
  pipeline over the same textual corpus. Details to be pinned in this
  entry before the first run.
- **Decision rule:** per-stratum comparison with CIs and paired
  tests; the hypothesis survives only if the observed pattern matches
  the predicted stratification, not merely if the aggregate favors
  the graph.
- **Expected result:** graph ≫ vector on `fail`, graph > vector on
  `lose`, no significant difference on `tie`.
- **Actual result:** _pending (Phase 8)._

## E-002 — MetaQA calibration

- **Registered:** _not yet — to be registered with full configuration
  before the first calibration run (Phase 6)._
- **Objective (declared intent only):** run the same machinery on an
  academic multi-hop benchmark with an answer key, to separate "the
  pipeline works" from "the domain is hard" before any claim on MTG.

## E-003 — Linking and extraction quality against manual annotations

- **Registered:** 2026-07-20 (a priori — the sample froze first at seed
  `20260720` in `data/golden/extraction_sample_ids.json`; no extractor
  has run on either split, and the annotation labels do not exist yet).
- **Objective:** measure card-mention linking and `CITES_RULE`
  extraction P/R/F1 against 125 manually annotated rulings; only
  gate-passing edges ever enter the graph.
- **Configuration:** frozen sample 30 dev / 125 annotation (strata:
  homonym 60, multiword 50, plain 40, explicit 5); linker cascade v1
  (exact → loose → surface + LLM disambiguation); extractor v1 (open
  and grounded modes); gate `min_confidence = 0.7`; metrics = micro
  P/R/F1 with per-document bootstrap CIs (`evaluation/metrics.py`),
  stratified by sampling stratum. Model pinned in the run log at run
  time.
- **Blinding rule:** annotation labels are written without ever running
  the extractor on the annotation split; prompt iteration happens on
  the dev split only. The annotation split is touched by the system
  exactly once, after `check_extraction_annotations.py --publish`.
- **Hypothesis / predictions:** deterministic stages near ceiling on
  the multiword stratum (F1 ≥ 0.95); the homonym stratum is the open
  question and predicted hardest; `CITES_RULE` F1 predicted below
  linking F1. Pass thresholds (roadmap DoD): linking F1 ≥ 0.9 overall,
  `CITES_RULE` F1 ≥ 0.75.
- **Decision rule (gate G3, week 1, on the dev split):** trivial
  (F1 > 0.95 with no prompt effort) → shift Phase 3 weight to implicit
  CR cross-references; infeasible (F1 < 0.5 after 3 documented prompt
  iterations) → reduce the schema and report the negative result.
  Threshold changes after seeing annotation-split results are not
  permitted; any adjustment needs a dated decision-journal entry
  *before* the run it applies to.
- **Amendment 2026-08-08 (before the run, no results seen):** the CR
  corpus moved from the 2026-02-27 release to 2026-08-07, because the
  rulings snapshot (2026-07-17) was newer than the CR and some rulings
  cited rules absent from it. Labels were migrated by rule text via
  `scripts/cr_migrate.py` (71 of 79 cited rules unchanged, 4 relocated,
  4 edited without semantic change, 0 orphaned) and every row now carries
  `cr_version`. No threshold, sample, cascade, or metric changed; the
  annotation split still has not been touched by the extractor. Rationale
  in `docs/decision-journal.md` (2026-08-08).
- **Actual result:** _pending._
