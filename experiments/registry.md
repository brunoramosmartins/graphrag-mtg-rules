# Experiment Registry

Every experiment is registered **before** it runs: ID, objective,
hypothesis, configuration, decision rule, expected result. The actual
result is filled in afterwards and never edits the prediction. Entries
for work that predates this registry carry an explicit
`registered: retrospectively` field; the registry is forward-looking
from 2026-07-19 on.

Metric reporting rules (binding, see [../docs/evaluation.md](../docs/evaluation.md)):
confidence intervals always, paired tests for paired comparisons, a
multiple-comparison correction when strata are tested jointly.

## E-001 — Graph traversal vs. vector baseline on the golden set

- **Registered:** 2026-07-19 (a priori — predictions were recorded in
  [../docs/evaluation.md](../docs/evaluation.md) and
  `data/golden/*.jsonl` before any retrieval system existed).
- **Objective:** test the central hypothesis
  ([../docs/hypothesis.md](../docs/hypothesis.md)) that judge-level
  questions are path-shaped and measurably out of reach of vector
  retrieval.
- **Hypothesis / predictions:** per-question `vector_should` labels —
  39 fail / 23 lose / 15 tie across 77 questions. The `tie` stratum
  (`definition_1hop`) is the falsifier: if the graph "wins" there too,
  distrust the harness before celebrating.
- **Configuration:** frozen golden set v0 (77 questions, all
  verified); graph pipeline (Phases 4–5) vs. the Project 1 vector
  pipeline over the same textual corpus. Details to be pinned in this
  entry before the first run.
- **Decision rule:** per-stratum comparison with CIs and paired
  tests; the hypothesis survives only if the observed pattern matches
  the predicted stratification, not merely if the aggregate favors
  the graph.
- **Expected result:** graph ≫ vector on `fail`, graph > vector on
  `lose`, no significant difference on `tie`.
- **Actual result:** _pending (Phase 8)._

## E-002 — MetaQA calibration

- **Registered:** _not yet — to be registered with full configuration
  before the first calibration run (Phase 6)._
- **Objective (declared intent only):** run the same machinery on an
  academic multi-hop benchmark with an answer key, to separate "the
  pipeline works" from "the domain is hard" before any claim on MTG.

## E-003 — Linking and extraction quality against manual annotations

- **Registered:** 2026-07-20 (a priori — the sample froze first at seed
  `20260720` in `data/golden/extraction_sample_ids.json`; no extractor
  has run on either split, and the annotation labels do not exist yet).
- **Objective:** measure card-mention linking and `CITES_RULE`
  extraction P/R/F1 against 125 manually annotated rulings; only
  gate-passing edges ever enter the graph.
- **Configuration:** frozen sample 30 dev / 125 annotation (strata:
  homonym 60, multiword 50, plain 40, explicit 5); linker cascade v1
  (exact → loose → surface + LLM disambiguation); extractor v1 (open
  and grounded modes); gate `min_confidence = 0.7`; metrics = micro
  P/R/F1 with per-document bootstrap CIs (`evaluation/metrics.py`),
  stratified by sampling stratum. Model pinned in the run log at run
  time.
- **Blinding rule:** annotation labels are written without ever running
  the extractor on the annotation split; prompt iteration happens on
  the dev split only. The annotation split is touched by the system
  exactly once, after `check_extraction_annotations.py --publish`.
- **Hypothesis / predictions:** deterministic stages near ceiling on
  the multiword stratum (F1 ≥ 0.95); the homonym stratum is the open
  question and predicted hardest; `CITES_RULE` F1 predicted below
  linking F1. Pass thresholds (roadmap DoD): linking F1 ≥ 0.9 overall,
  `CITES_RULE` F1 ≥ 0.75.
- **Decision rule (gate G3, week 1, on the dev split):** trivial
  (F1 > 0.95 with no prompt effort) → shift Phase 3 weight to implicit
  CR cross-references; infeasible (F1 < 0.5 after 3 documented prompt
  iterations) → reduce the schema and report the negative result.
  Threshold changes after seeing annotation-split results are not
  permitted; any adjustment needs a dated decision-journal entry
  *before* the run it applies to.
- **Amendment 2026-08-08 (before the run, no results seen):** the CR
  corpus moved from the 2026-02-27 release to 2026-08-07, because the
  rulings snapshot (2026-07-17) was newer than the CR and some rulings
  cited rules absent from it. Labels were migrated by rule text via
  `scripts/cr_migrate.py` (71 of 79 cited rules unchanged, 4 relocated,
  4 edited without semantic change, 0 orphaned) and every row now carries
  `cr_version`. No threshold, sample, cascade, or metric changed; the
  annotation split still has not been touched by the extractor. Rationale
  in `docs/decision-journal.md` (2026-08-08).
- **Secondary metric added 2026-08-08, after the first dev run, before the
  annotation split was touched:** citations are also scored on
  `(ruling_id, rule_family)`, where `rule_family` drops the trailing subrule
  letter (`702.33d` → `702.33`). The first dev run showed the extractor
  routinely naming the right rule at the wrong depth — gold `608.2b`, predicted
  `608.2` — which exact match counts twice against, as a false positive and a
  false negative. `(ruling_id, rule_number)` **remains the primary metric and
  the one the E-003 threshold of 0.75 applies to**; the family score is
  reported beside it as diagnosis, never in place of it. Loosening the primary
  key after seeing that the errors are depth errors would be fitting the ruler
  to the result.
- **Prompt-iteration budget, fixed 2026-08-08 (before any run):** citation
  extraction gets at most 3 documented prompt iterations, judged against a
  **15-ruling subset of the dev split** — 5 per dev stratum, chosen with seed
  `20260808` and frozen in `data/golden/dev_citation_subset.json`. The dev split
  carries verified `mentions` for all 30 rulings, so linking iteration is
  unaffected. The subset was drawn before any citation was annotated on it, and
  the annotation split remains untouched. Deliberately a subset, not the whole
  dev split: enough signal to tell two prompts apart, at half the manual cost.
- **Adjudication rule, pre-registered 2026-08-08 (before any run, no results
  seen):** after the annotation-split run, the annotator may inspect the rows
  where the system and the gold disagree. A gold label may be changed **only**
  when it is wrong on its own terms under `docs/extraction-annotation-guide.md`
  — the rule number does not exist, does not govern the question the ruling
  answers, or contradicts the annotator's own note. It may never be changed
  because the model disagrees with it, and never to move a metric. Every change
  is logged in `docs/decision-journal.md` with ruling id, before, after, and
  reason. `docs/evaluation.md` reports **both** the pre-adjudication and the
  post-adjudication figures, and the pre-adjudication figure is the headline.
  If adjudication would touch more than **10% of the gold**, the gold is not
  reliable enough to measure against: the run is void and the sample is
  re-annotated rather than patched.
- **Known limitation, recorded 2026-08-08:** intra-annotator agreement has not
  been measured — the annotator has not blind-re-annotated a subsample. The
  reliability of the gold is therefore unquantified and the attainable ceiling
  on F1 is unknown. `docs/evaluation.md` must state this beside the results.
  Deferred by the author, not overlooked.
- **Iterations spent (dev only, 2026-08-08):** 3 of 3. (1) removed the "cite the
  parent you are sure of" fallback: 0.054 → 0.118. (2) dropped the keyword
  directory and added three-step reasoning: 0.118 → 0.000. (3) restored the
  directory, kept the reasoning: **0.167 [0.000, 0.333]** primary, 0.312
  [0.121, 0.529] family. Best configuration: prompt `v3` with the keyword
  directory. Linking unchanged throughout at 0.706 [0.444, 0.868].
- **Gate G3, decided 2026-08-08 on the dev split:** citation F1 0.167 after three
  documented iterations is below the 0.5 infeasibility line, so the registered
  rule applies — reduce the schema and report the negative result. The
  annotation-split run still happens, to report that negative with the sample
  and intervals it was registered for, and to measure linking.
- **Amendment 2026-08-09 (dev only; annotation split still untouched):** two
  defects found while diagnosing linking. (1) `LlmClient` set no `temperature`,
  so no run was reproducible — the same configuration scored citation F1 0.167
  and 0.114 on consecutive runs, a spread the size of the iteration effects.
  Temperature is now pinned to 0 and **the three prompt iterations are retired
  as unattributable**; the reproducible figure for the best configuration is
  citation F1 **0.057 [0.000, 0.176]** primary, **0.250 [0.067, 0.437]** family.
  G3's infeasibility call stands and is firmer. (2) Linker cascade v1 → **v2**:
  a match strictly inside a longer occurrence of the host card's name is
  dropped ("Legion" inside "Kemba's Legion"), lifting linking F1 to **0.727
  [0.476, 0.889]**, tp=12 fp=6 fn=3. Broader forms of the rule, and a
  type/keyword stoplist, were measured against the dev gold and rejected — both
  cost as many true positives as they won. The annotation-split run will use
  cascade v2, prompt v3 with the keyword directory, temperature 0.
- **Actual result (2026-08-09, annotation split, single run, pre-adjudication):**
  linking F1 **0.634 [0.491, 0.750]** (tp=26 fp=26 fn=4) against a 0.90
  threshold — **fail**; citation F1 **0.125 [0.073, 0.180]** (tp=19 fp=121
  fn=146) against 0.75 — **fail**; citation family F1 0.252 [0.188, 0.323].
  Predictions: multiword-at-ceiling **falsified** (0.760, upper bound 0.871
  below the predicted 0.95 floor); homonym-hardest **confirmed** (0.438, and 16
  of 26 linking false positives); citations-below-linking **confirmed** (0.125
  vs 0.634). G3 fires: reduce the schema, report the negative. Full write-up
  with limitations in `docs/evaluation.md`.

### E-003a — intra-annotator agreement (the ceiling)

- **Registered:** 2026-08-09, before the second pass is written. Closes the
  known limitation recorded 2026-08-08.
- **Objective:** measure how much the annotator agrees with themself, so the
  E-003 citation F1 can be read against a ceiling instead of against 1.0. If a
  second blind pass over the same rulings cites different rules, the task is
  ambiguous and no system could have scored higher.
- **Configuration:** 20 rulings drawn from the citation-reviewed rows of the
  annotation split, stratified proportionally, seed `20260809`, frozen in
  `data/golden/reannotation_sample_ids.json`. Pass 2 is written into a blinded
  copy (`scripts/reannotate.py draw`) carrying the ruling text and mentions but
  no `cited_rules`, using the same tools as pass 1 (`cite_search.py`,
  `annotation_worksheet.py --citation-pass`, `cite.py`) — a different tool would
  measure the tool, not the annotator. Metric: the E-003 citation metric
  unchanged, micro P/R/F1 on `(ruling_id, rule_number)` with per-document
  bootstrap CIs, pass 1 as reference; family score reported beside it. Micro F1
  is symmetric, so the direction is presentational only.
- **Ordering constraint (binding):** pass 2 must be written **before** the
  annotator inspects any E-003 disagreement (E-003b). Re-reading rulings that
  were just re-litigated against the model's output is recall, not an
  independent second pass.
- **Hypothesis / prediction:** agreement F1 well below 1.0 and well above the
  measured 0.125 — the author's stated reason is that two rules can both
  support a ruling. No threshold: this is a measurement, not a test.
- **Use and non-use:** the figure is reported in `docs/evaluation.md` beside the
  E-003 result and replaces the "agreement unmeasured" limitation. It does
  **not** license changing any gold label, does not change the E-003 thresholds,
  and is not used to rescale any reported score.
- **Known limitation:** the rulings were annotated in the days before the draw,
  so memory inflates agreement; the figure is an optimistic bound on the
  ceiling. `reannotate.py compare` prints the elapsed days and says so.
- **Actual result (2026-08-09, 20 rulings, same-day second pass):** citation
  agreement F1 **0.815 [0.679, 0.938]** primary, **0.902 [0.800, 0.980]**
  family; tp=22 fp=5 fn=5; 14 of 20 rulings cited identically (0.70 [0.48,
  0.85], Wilson). No decision rule applies — E-003a was registered as a
  measurement, not a test, so this section is descriptive by construction and
  no branch is taken. Reproducible from `scripts/reannotate.py compare`, which
  refuses to report on a partial second pass.
  **What it settles:** the gold is not the explanation for E-003's citation
  score. For annotator unreliability to account for F1 0.125, the annotator
  would have to agree with themself at roughly that rate; the measured
  agreement is 0.815, and the same-day inflation would have to be worth ~0.69
  of F1 for the two to meet. Per the registration, the ceiling is reported
  beside the result and is **not** used to rescale it.
  **Structure of the disagreement** (all 6 divergent rulings, read from the
  compare output): 3 are granularity — parent versus child (`303.4a`/`303.4`,
  `706.2b` dropped with `706.2` kept) or sibling leaves (`603.7b`/`603.7c`);
  2 are completeness — the second pass adds a rule the first did not cite
  (`601.2c`, `702.174a`) without contradicting it; 1 is a genuine conflict with
  no overlap (`709.4` vs `202.3d`). This is what the 0.815/0.902 gap is made
  of, and it is the same failure the family metric was added to separate.

### E-003b — composition of the E-003 disagreements

- **Registered:** 2026-08-09, before any disagreement is inspected.
- **Objective:** decompose the citation F1 gap. Exact match scores a wrong rule
  and a *differently defensible* rule identically, so 0.125 is consistent with
  several different worlds and by itself names none of them.
- **Configuration:** a seeded random sample of the annotation-split
  disagreements (false positives and false negatives) from the recorded E-003
  run, sized so each proportion below carries a usable interval. Each sampled
  disagreement is classified into exactly one bucket:
  - `gold_right` — the gold is correct and the prediction is wrong: model error.
  - `both_defensible` — the predicted rule also governs the interaction: an
    artifact of exact match, neither a model error nor a gold error.
  - `gold_wrong` — the gold is wrong on its own terms under
    `docs/extraction-annotation-guide.md`: adjudicable.
  - `unclear` — parked, and counted, rather than forced into a bucket.
- **Reported as:** the four proportions with confidence intervals. Not an F1,
  and not a correction to one.
- **Relation to adjudication (important):** this is measurement, not repair. It
  changes no gold label. A sample cannot patch the gold — a partly-patched gold
  makes both the pre- and post-adjudication figures meaningless — so the
  pre-registered adjudication rule (2026-08-08) continues to govern any change,
  including its 10% cap and its requirement that a label be wrong on its own
  terms. If `gold_wrong` comes back high, the honest response is the one that
  rule already names: void and re-annotate, not patch.
- **Hypothesis / prediction:** `both_defensible` is the largest bucket after
  `gold_right`, and `gold_wrong` is small. Recorded before any case is read.
- **Note 2026-08-09, prediction deliberately NOT amended:** E-003a landed first
  and is weak evidence against the prediction above — of the annotator's own 6
  divergences, only 1 was a genuine conflict between two different rules, the
  rest being granularity or completeness. That is evidence about one person
  disagreeing with themself, not about a model disagreeing with a person, and
  in any case a prediction edited after seeing adjacent data is not a
  prediction. It stands as written and will be scored as written.
- **Actual result (2026-08-09, 40 cases over 33 rulings, seed `20260810`):**
  `gold_right` **40/40**; `both_defensible` 0; `gold_wrong` 0; `unclear` 0.
  Composition by direction: 16 false positives and 24 false negatives, all
  `gold_right`. **The registered prediction is falsified** — `both_defensible`
  was predicted to be the largest bucket after `gold_right` and is empty.
  - **Interval:** the cluster bootstrap prints `[1.000, 1.000]`, which is
    degenerate, not certain — a percentile bootstrap on a sample with no
    variation resamples to itself. The reportable bound is rule-of-three over
    33 clusters: everything other than `gold_right` is at most **0.091** (95%).
    `report` now detects unanimity and prints this instead of the false
    interval; `metrics.rule_of_three_upper` is the shared implementation.
  - **What it settles:** the citation gap is model error. It is not a metric
    artifact (`both_defensible` = 0) and not gold error (`gold_wrong` = 0, so
    the 10% adjudication cap is not approached and no label changes). Together
    with E-003a's ceiling of 0.815, both alternative explanations for F1 0.125
    are now measured and excluded.
- **Threat to validity, recorded because it is not resolved by more sampling:**
  the judge wrote the gold. Unanimity in one's own favour is exactly what a
  lenient self-judge produces, and it cannot be distinguished from correctness
  by this design. A concrete asymmetry is measurable and is now printed by
  `report`: **9 of the 40 cases are a wrong leaf rather than a wrong rule**
  (`608.2` against gold `608.2b`, `704.5g` against gold `704.5d`/`704.5f`,
  sibling subrules of `702.131`, `702.33`, `702.179`, `701.54`), and E-003a
  found precisely this to be the annotator's commonest disagreement with
  themself (3 of 6). All 9 were judged model error. That is defensible —
  sibling subrules can be genuinely different rules — but it is one standard
  applied to the model and another absorbed as ceiling.
  **It is bounded and does not change the conclusion:** the family score
  already prices depth leniency in full, and there the model reads 0.252
  against a family ceiling of 0.902. Removing the leniency question entirely
  still leaves the model at roughly a quarter of the attainable score. What
  would resolve it is an independent judge, not a bigger sample; registered as
  future work, not attempted here.
- **Sample coverage gap:** 13 of 125 rulings produced no citation at all,
  contributing 13 of the 267 disagreements (4.9%); none were drawn into the 40.
  That failure mode — the extractor returning nothing — is therefore
  unmeasured by E-003b.
- **CR-version check (asked 2026-08-09, answered from the data):** the CR
  upgrade did not contaminate this analysis. All 125 annotation rows carry
  `cr_version = "August 7, 2026"`, the same release the extractor was grounded
  on, so gold and system were scored against one document. **0 of the 267
  disagreements cite a rule number absent from the current CR** — a
  version-skew artifact would show up here first, and does not. Of the 4
  citations the migration remapped, exactly one falls inside the 40 sampled
  cases (`310.10` -> `310.11`, ruling `41f59f3c34ff`) and it was judged with
  the current rule text on screen.
