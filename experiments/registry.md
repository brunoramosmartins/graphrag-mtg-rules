# Experiment Registry

Every experiment is registered **before** it runs: ID, objective,
hypothesis, configuration, decision rule, expected result. The actual
result is filled in afterwards and never edits the prediction. Entries
for work that predates this registry carry an explicit
`registered: retrospectively` field; the registry is forward-looking
from 2026-07-19 on.

Metric reporting rules (binding, see [../docs/evaluation.md](../docs/evaluation.md)):
confidence intervals always, paired tests for paired comparisons, a
multiple-comparison correction when strata are tested jointly.

## E-001 — Graph traversal vs. vector baseline on the golden set

- **Registered:** 2026-07-19 (a priori — predictions were recorded in
  [../docs/evaluation.md](../docs/evaluation.md) and
  `data/golden/*.jsonl` before any retrieval system existed).
- **Objective:** test the central hypothesis
  ([../docs/hypothesis.md](../docs/hypothesis.md)) that judge-level
  questions are path-shaped and measurably out of reach of vector
  retrieval.
- **Hypothesis / predictions:** per-question `vector_should` labels —
  39 fail / 23 lose / 15 tie across 77 questions. The `tie` stratum
  (`definition_1hop`) is the falsifier: if the graph "wins" there too,
  distrust the harness before celebrating.
- **Configuration:** frozen golden set v0 (77 questions, all
  verified); graph pipeline (Phases 4–5) vs. the Project 1 vector
  pipeline over the same textual corpus. Details to be pinned in this
  entry before the first run.
- **Decision rule:** per-stratum comparison with CIs and paired
  tests; the hypothesis survives only if the observed pattern matches
  the predicted stratification, not merely if the aggregate favors
  the graph.
- **Expected result:** graph ≫ vector on `fail`, graph > vector on
  `lose`, no significant difference on `tie`.
- **Actual result:** _pending (Phase 8)._

## E-002 — MetaQA calibration

- **Registered:** _not yet — to be registered with full configuration
  before the first calibration run (Phase 6)._
- **Objective (declared intent only):** run the same machinery on an
  academic multi-hop benchmark with an answer key, to separate "the
  pipeline works" from "the domain is hard" before any claim on MTG.

## E-003 — Linking and extraction quality against manual annotations

- **Registered:** 2026-07-20 (a priori — the sample froze first at seed
  `20260720` in `data/golden/extraction_sample_ids.json`; no extractor
  has run on either split, and the annotation labels do not exist yet).
- **Objective:** measure card-mention linking and `CITES_RULE`
  extraction P/R/F1 against 125 manually annotated rulings; only
  gate-passing edges ever enter the graph.
- **Configuration:** frozen sample 30 dev / 125 annotation (strata:
  homonym 60, multiword 50, plain 40, explicit 5); linker cascade v1
  (exact → loose → surface + LLM disambiguation); extractor v1 (open
  and grounded modes); gate `min_confidence = 0.7`; metrics = micro
  P/R/F1 with per-document bootstrap CIs (`evaluation/metrics.py`),
  stratified by sampling stratum. Model pinned in the run log at run
  time.
- **Blinding rule:** annotation labels are written without ever running
  the extractor on the annotation split; prompt iteration happens on
  the dev split only. The annotation split is touched by the system
  exactly once, after `check_extraction_annotations.py --publish`.
- **Hypothesis / predictions:** deterministic stages near ceiling on
  the multiword stratum (F1 ≥ 0.95); the homonym stratum is the open
  question and predicted hardest; `CITES_RULE` F1 predicted below
  linking F1. Pass thresholds (roadmap DoD): linking F1 ≥ 0.9 overall,
  `CITES_RULE` F1 ≥ 0.75.
- **Decision rule (gate G3, week 1, on the dev split):** trivial
  (F1 > 0.95 with no prompt effort) → shift Phase 3 weight to implicit
  CR cross-references; infeasible (F1 < 0.5 after 3 documented prompt
  iterations) → reduce the schema and report the negative result.
  Threshold changes after seeing annotation-split results are not
  permitted; any adjustment needs a dated decision-journal entry
  *before* the run it applies to.
- **Amendment 2026-08-08 (before the run, no results seen):** the CR
  corpus moved from the 2026-02-27 release to 2026-08-07, because the
  rulings snapshot (2026-07-17) was newer than the CR and some rulings
  cited rules absent from it. Labels were migrated by rule text via
  `scripts/cr_migrate.py` (71 of 79 cited rules unchanged, 4 relocated,
  4 edited without semantic change, 0 orphaned) and every row now carries
  `cr_version`. No threshold, sample, cascade, or metric changed; the
  annotation split still has not been touched by the extractor. Rationale
  in `docs/decision-journal.md` (2026-08-08).
- **Secondary metric added 2026-08-08, after the first dev run, before the
  annotation split was touched:** citations are also scored on
  `(ruling_id, rule_family)`, where `rule_family` drops the trailing subrule
  letter (`702.33d` → `702.33`). The first dev run showed the extractor
  routinely naming the right rule at the wrong depth — gold `608.2b`, predicted
  `608.2` — which exact match counts twice against, as a false positive and a
  false negative. `(ruling_id, rule_number)` **remains the primary metric and
  the one the E-003 threshold of 0.75 applies to**; the family score is
  reported beside it as diagnosis, never in place of it. Loosening the primary
  key after seeing that the errors are depth errors would be fitting the ruler
  to the result.
- **Prompt-iteration budget, fixed 2026-08-08 (before any run):** citation
  extraction gets at most 3 documented prompt iterations, judged against a
  **15-ruling subset of the dev split** — 5 per dev stratum, chosen with seed
  `20260808` and frozen in `data/golden/dev_citation_subset.json`. The dev split
  carries verified `mentions` for all 30 rulings, so linking iteration is
  unaffected. The subset was drawn before any citation was annotated on it, and
  the annotation split remains untouched. Deliberately a subset, not the whole
  dev split: enough signal to tell two prompts apart, at half the manual cost.
- **Adjudication rule, pre-registered 2026-08-08 (before any run, no results
  seen):** after the annotation-split run, the annotator may inspect the rows
  where the system and the gold disagree. A gold label may be changed **only**
  when it is wrong on its own terms under `docs/extraction-annotation-guide.md`
  — the rule number does not exist, does not govern the question the ruling
  answers, or contradicts the annotator's own note. It may never be changed
  because the model disagrees with it, and never to move a metric. Every change
  is logged in `docs/decision-journal.md` with ruling id, before, after, and
  reason. `docs/evaluation.md` reports **both** the pre-adjudication and the
  post-adjudication figures, and the pre-adjudication figure is the headline.
  If adjudication would touch more than **10% of the gold**, the gold is not
  reliable enough to measure against: the run is void and the sample is
  re-annotated rather than patched.
- **Known limitation, recorded 2026-08-08:** intra-annotator agreement has not
  been measured — the annotator has not blind-re-annotated a subsample. The
  reliability of the gold is therefore unquantified and the attainable ceiling
  on F1 is unknown. `docs/evaluation.md` must state this beside the results.
  Deferred by the author, not overlooked.
- **Iterations spent (dev only, 2026-08-08):** 3 of 3. (1) removed the "cite the
  parent you are sure of" fallback: 0.054 → 0.118. (2) dropped the keyword
  directory and added three-step reasoning: 0.118 → 0.000. (3) restored the
  directory, kept the reasoning: **0.167 [0.000, 0.333]** primary, 0.312
  [0.121, 0.529] family. Best configuration: prompt `v3` with the keyword
  directory. Linking unchanged throughout at 0.706 [0.444, 0.868].
- **Gate G3, decided 2026-08-08 on the dev split:** citation F1 0.167 after three
  documented iterations is below the 0.5 infeasibility line, so the registered
  rule applies — reduce the schema and report the negative result. The
  annotation-split run still happens, to report that negative with the sample
  and intervals it was registered for, and to measure linking.
- **Amendment 2026-08-09 (dev only; annotation split still untouched):** two
  defects found while diagnosing linking. (1) `LlmClient` set no `temperature`,
  so no run was reproducible — the same configuration scored citation F1 0.167
  and 0.114 on consecutive runs, a spread the size of the iteration effects.
  Temperature is now pinned to 0 and **the three prompt iterations are retired
  as unattributable**; the reproducible figure for the best configuration is
  citation F1 **0.057 [0.000, 0.176]** primary, **0.250 [0.067, 0.437]** family.
  G3's infeasibility call stands and is firmer. (2) Linker cascade v1 → **v2**:
  a match strictly inside a longer occurrence of the host card's name is
  dropped ("Legion" inside "Kemba's Legion"), lifting linking F1 to **0.727
  [0.476, 0.889]**, tp=12 fp=6 fn=3. Broader forms of the rule, and a
  type/keyword stoplist, were measured against the dev gold and rejected — both
  cost as many true positives as they won. The annotation-split run will use
  cascade v2, prompt v3 with the keyword directory, temperature 0.
- **Actual result:** _pending — annotation split not yet run._
